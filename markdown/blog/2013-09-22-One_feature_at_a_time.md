Finally, after a year of design and procrastination, I have together with a friend started doing some real work on Lucy. As with all games, in the beginning you have to lay down some gaming systems that are fairly big in size, especially when making a game that is unlike the games modern game engines are designed for.

A big goal with Lucy is to try and make features as small as possible while still adding to the experience. The basic idea is that for every development hour put into the game, a lot of game time should be added. A lot of game developers brags about how they are using agile development when that is not really true. If you already have a to clear picture about what the game is going to be, it is difficult to find the small and surprising way to make a game more engaging.

Also notice that I'm using the game engaging instead of fun. The other day while talking to a friend, he brought up the fact that most games have no really good characters with a true conviction in what they are doing like in the musical Les Miserables. Therefore, I decided to change the characters in Lucy from being very goofy into still being kind if goofy but have even more facets. It will be an interesting challenge (for a programmer). :)
