It has now almost been a year and a half since I started working at Mojang and started working with games for real. It has also now been ten years since I decided to become a game developer and during this time I have also worked on several game and game project (some these games can be found on the Game page). It is however something entirely different to really work with games for a living. I have tried to continue to improve as a developer while still keeping my passion for games.

The next step will be to try to invite all of you guys in order to keep talking about gaming. Since Minecraft Pocket Edition is a mammoth size project where at times not much seems to be happening (because of testing and low level stuff), I will also start talking about a fun new side project that I will soon start working (not connected to Mojang). The new project is called Lucy and I will start coding on it in August, I will of course still work full time on Pocket Edition and more than that when needed but Lucy will give me a chance to grow as a developer. :)

I will also try to be more active on twitter, the problem recently has been time where I had to choose between twitter and code. I’ll soon get back to working on smaller features more noticed by players with a lot more you guys feedback.
