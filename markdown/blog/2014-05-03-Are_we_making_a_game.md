When I was starting to develop games back in 2004, I of course focused on the technical aspects of game development. There where all of these awesome techniques used by all the games I loved like DirectX, DirectShow, DirectSound and they became my main focus. I think the reason for that is that you can put them in concrete smaller problem that can be attacked rather than difficult questions about game play. That’s at least how I was approaching game programming.

The problem with this kind of development is that the focus start moving away from the game you are trying to make toward the specific things you are currently working on. If you are working on the animation system, you put everything else aside and only focus on that, game or no game.

I have now really gotten tired of this way of developing games (note that we don’t develop this way at Mojang but a lot of other companies does). Therefor when I started developing Lucy (which is not a Mojang game and on which still haven’t written a single line of code), I decided to not do any technical stuff at all. No awesome new way of making a tiled 2d game with beveling and advanced lighting. All that stuff can come later. The thing that you do all the time in the game, that needs to be fun!

In future post, I’m going to look back at earlier projects and contrast them with the work on Lucy. Also, I’m going to make a first free alpha version of Lucy that people can try out later this year with an aim of releasing the full game next year.

Note: all game projects needs an impossible deadline. :)
